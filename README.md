# MathQuiz

## Overview
This java project consists of two main classes: Program7 and MathQuiz.  The program is an interactive math quiz that challenges users with arithmetic problems based on chosen difficulty levels. I generates math questions with random numbers and operators, collects the answers from the user, and provides feedback randomly on whether answers are correct or incorrect.

- ### Program7:
Initiates the quiz ensuring the files, correct.txt and incorrect.txt, exists and contain data, setting the stage for the MathQuiz class to take over.

- ### MathQuiz:
This class presents users with math questions that vary in complexity.  the program generates these questions by randomly combining numbers and operators, and it evaluates userr responses in real-time.
